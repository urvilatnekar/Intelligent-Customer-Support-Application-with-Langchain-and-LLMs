# Intelligent-Customer-Support-Application-with-Langchain-and-LLMs

# 1. Problem Overview
Why:

Current Issues: Customer support systems deal with a large volume of tickets, often resulting in delayed responses, poor prioritization, and inconsistent customer experience. As the volume increases, human intervention becomes expensive and inefficient.

By leveraging LLMs, the project aims to automate these processes by analyzing ticket content and generating appropriate responses. This reduces operational costs, increases efficiency, and improves customer satisfaction.

How:

Automating Ticket Management: Using LLMs for sentiment analysis, ticket categorization, and response generation ensures that critical issues are prioritized and dealt with promptly. Azure ML enables the system to scale efficiently, handling an increasing number of tickets.

# 2. Prerequisites

Why:

To execute this project effectively, familiarity with Large Language Models (LLMs), Vector Databases, Prompt Engineering, and development using Python and Streamlit is required. The knowledge of these topics helps streamline the development process.

How:

Before starting, you need to ensure you’ve completed a foundational project where an LLM is fine-tuned. This ensures that you have experience with training and fine-tuning LLMs, which will be critical when customizing the response generation based on the customer service dataset.

# 3. Data Description

Why:

The Bitext Customer Service Tagged Training Dataset is essential because it provides a rich set of examples for training LLMs to understand the common issues in customer support. The dataset includes ticket data (instructions, categories, intents, responses) and linguistic tags to reflect real-life conversations.

How:

The dataset includes fields like instruction, intent, and response, which help the LLM learn to categorize issues and generate responses. Tags are included to allow customization of responses for various customer profiles (e.g., formal vs. informal language).

# 4. Project Aim

Why:

The project aims to enhance customer support efficiency while reducing costs. Automating the process of ticket handling using LLMs leads to faster ticket resolution, improved customer experience, and lower operational expenses.

How:

By automating ticket classification and response generation, support systems become faster and more reliable, allowing agents to focus on high-priority tasks while routine queries are handled by the AI.

# 5. Tech Stack

Why:

The tech stack was carefully chosen to balance powerful model integration (OpenAI’s GPT-4), scalability (Azure ML), and efficient data processing (pandas, FAISS).

How:

Python 3.10 is used for code implementation. The libraries such as langchain and openai are used to integrate OpenAI’s models. FAISS is used for fast similarity search on embeddings, while Streamlit provides a simple user interface. Azure ML is leveraged for deployment and scalability.

# 6. Approach

## a. Azure ML Workspace Setup

Why:

Azure ML provides a robust infrastructure for model training, deployment, and scaling, which is crucial for this project to handle large volumes of customer tickets in real-time.
How:

Azure ML Workspace is configured to link with the local environment, allowing for efficient management of data, training, and deployment workflows.

## b. Data Loading and Analysis
Why:

Understanding and analyzing the dataset helps define the problem better and guide the integration of LLMs for ticket categorization and response generation.

How:

Load the retail dataset (customer support tickets) into a pandas DataFrame and perform exploratory data analysis to identify the distribution of tickets, common categories, and intents. This helps in building appropriate LLM prompts and response strategies.

## c. LLM Integration

Why:

LLMs are needed to process customer ticket data, categorize them based on content, and generate relevant responses.

How:

Integrate pre-trained LLMs like GPT-4, which will be fine-tuned on the customer support data for optimal performance. The LLM generates both embeddings and responses for incoming queries.

## d. Vector Database Setup

Why:

FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is essential for handling large-scale retrieval of similar queries and responses, which allows the system to quickly match incoming tickets to previously seen queries.

How:

A vector database stores embeddings generated by the LLM. When a new query comes in, its embedding is compared with stored embeddings to retrieve relevant past responses efficiently.

## e. Prompt Engineering

Why:

Properly designed prompts ensure that the LLM generates accurate and contextually appropriate responses.

How:

Develop multiple prompting strategies and refine them over time, guiding the LLM to respond with clarity and precision. Experiment with different ways to phrase prompts for the best responses.

## f. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Implementation

Why:

Combining retrieval-based and generation-based approaches leads to more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

How:

Implement the RAG architecture, where a query’s embedding is used to retrieve relevant responses from the FAISS index. The LLM uses this information to generate a final response. This hybrid approach increases response accuracy.

## g. Response Generation and Sampling

Why:

Generating a variety of possible responses helps maintain high-quality interactions by selecting the most appropriate response.

How:

Implement a response sampling mechanism where the model generates multiple candidates. The best response is selected through a ranking algorithm, ensuring that the final output is contextually relevant.

## h. Feedback Loop

Why:

Over time, feedback can help improve response accuracy and relevance by iterating on the prompt strategies.

How:

Build a feedback loop where each interaction’s results are evaluated, and prompts are adjusted to improve future responses.

## i. Code Modularity and Streamlit UI

Why:

Keeping the code modular ensures maintainability and scalability, while Streamlit provides an easy-to-use UI for customer support agents or admins.

How:

Modularize the code by separating the data loading, LLM integration, vector search, and response generation logic. Use Streamlit to build a simple front-end where users can input queries and receive generated responses.

## j. Azure Deployment

Why:

Deployment on Azure ensures the system can handle real-time customer queries and scale based on traffic.

How:

Deploy the entire application using Azure ML, which supports easy scaling and integration with other Azure services. This deployment enables handling large volumes of tickets across different regions.
